1) Run EquationMatcher
  1a) Input "2" upon running, which checks for x = 1 and x = 2 and then compares f(x=1) with f(x=2) to extrapolate a pattern. x > 2 is not necessary
      because we check if our induction is correct when we check for valid equations.
2) Run FilterFileName
3) Run FindEquation
4) Run ValidEquation

This code successfully determines that the equation for the sum, 1+2+...+n = n# is a+1*a/2. This algorithm can be used to determine if a product equation exists, however due to memory restrictions it has not yet been determined.
NOTE: the factorial equation n(n-1)! = n! is not a valid equation, since it is recursively defined; that is to say, '!' exists on both sides of the equation.
Our goal is to find a nonrecursive, direct equation for the product, just like for the sum.
